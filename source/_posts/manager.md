- What is the definition of management?
"Management can be broadly defined as leading and managing all organizations through activities that involve organizing, coordinating, and utilizing various human, financial, material, physical, knowledge-based, tangible assets, or other intangible resources (including planning, decision-making, organization, leadership, and control) to achieve organizational goals in an efficient and effective manner."

- Why is this definition used?
This definition falls under a descriptive definition. Its primary approach is to define the process with a goal-oriented perspective.

- What are some good approaches to management?
- Creating good rules, systems, or processes, as I personally understand them, is just one way of providing security in management. However, this is far from what constitutes good management.
- Motivating individuals by tapping into their fundamental drives, encouraging staff to actively and enthusiastically follow regulations. While regulations ensure compliance, they may not necessarily inspire willing and proactive participation in tasks.
